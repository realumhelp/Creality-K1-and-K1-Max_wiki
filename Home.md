## About

This guide explains the whole process to root Creality K1 and K1 Max.

The advantage is to have full access to the firmware and configuration files in order to be able to make changes to them.

If you don't know what you're doing, I don't recommend following this guide.

<u>Note:</u> Some of the firmwares were provided by Creality but have not yet been released publicly.
