## Restoration

- You need USB drive formatted in FAT32.

- Copy the desired `.img` firmware file you want to restore to the root of your USB drive and remove it from your computer.

  âš  Make sure there are no other files present on the USB drive.

- Turn on the printer.

- When your are on home screen, plug USB drive on the front of the printer.

- Connect over SSH to the printer, with `root` user and `creality` password and run this command:

  ```
  /etc/ota_bin/local_ota_update.sh /tmp/udisk/sda1/*.img
  ```

- You should then see the progress status as you go in the console.

- When the process is complete, if it says it's successful, just turn off the printer and turn it back on to boot into the new firmware.
