## Restoration

- You need USB drive formatted in FAT32.

- Copy the desired `.img` firmware file you want to restore to the root of your USB drive and remove it from your computer.

  âš  **Make sure there is no other file present on the USB drive except the firmware file.**

- Turn on the printer.

- When your are on home screen, plug USB drive on the front of the printer.

- Connect over SSH to the printer, with `root` user and `creality` password and run this command:

  ```
  /etc/ota_bin/local_ota_update.sh /tmp/udisk/sda1/*.img
  ```

- You should then see the progress status as you go in the console.

- When the process is complete, if it says it's successful, just turn off the printer and turn it back on to boot into the new firmware.
