Changing the hostname can be useful if you have multiple K1 printers to give them each a different hostname.

<br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This section is deprecated since firmware 1.3.2.20, Creality fixed this issue by setting the hostname with the MAC address of the machine.**

## Installation

- Make sure you have followed this [Installation Helper Script](https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-K1-and-K1-Max/wiki/Installation-Helper-Script) section before.

- In the script, enter in `[Install Menu]` by typing `1` and validate with `Enter` and install `Hostname Service file`:

- After reboot, your printer will take the name of the machine followed by the last 4 characters of its MAC address.
