Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging is an extension that allows you to generate a mesh only in the area you really need it: where you print!

Since the mesh area will be smaller, the mesh can be much more dense. Imagine making a 3x3 mesh, but the size of a [3DBenchy](https://www.3dbenchy.com/)!

<br />

**<u>Note:</u> This procedure must be repeated if you update the firmware or if you restore the printer to default settings.**
